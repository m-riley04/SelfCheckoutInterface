# SelfCheckoutInterface
A sleek, modular, and effective interface for dealing with self checkout stations in modern American grocery stores.

# Why?
I have experience working with self checkout stations, both as a consumer and as an employee, and there are some things that I believe they can improve on. I also just think this is a fun project that can show that I am capable of building something that multi-billion dollar mega-corporations use every single day.

# Definitions
